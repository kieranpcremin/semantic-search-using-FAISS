# Construction Safety Standards

## 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Requirements

All personnel entering active construction zones must wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times. The minimum required PPE includes a hard hat conforming to ANSI Z89.1 standards, safety glasses with side shields meeting ANSI Z87.1 requirements, high-visibility vests (Class 2 minimum), steel-toed boots rated to ASTM F2413, and work gloves suitable for the task being performed.

Additional PPE may be required depending on the specific work activity. Respiratory protection such as N95 masks or half-face respirators must be worn during demolition, grinding, or any dust-generating activity. Fall protection harnesses compliant with ANSI Z359.1 are mandatory when working at heights exceeding 6 feet above ground level. Hearing protection is required in areas where noise levels exceed 85 decibels.

## 2. Site Access and Security

Construction site access is restricted to authorized personnel only. All workers must complete site-specific orientation before beginning work. Visitors must check in at the site office and be escorted by authorized staff at all times. Vehicle access is limited to designated haul roads and parking areas.

Perimeter fencing with a minimum height of 6 feet must be maintained around all active work zones. Warning signs must be posted at intervals not exceeding 50 feet along the perimeter. Gate access points shall be staffed during working hours and secured with padlocks during off-hours.

## 3. Incident Reporting Procedures

All workplace incidents, regardless of severity, must be reported within 24 hours using the standardized incident report form. Near-miss events carry the same reporting requirement as actual incidents. The site safety manager must be notified immediately for any incident involving injury, property damage exceeding $500, or environmental release.

For serious injuries requiring medical attention beyond first aid, emergency services must be contacted immediately via 911. The area must be secured and preserved until the safety investigation team arrives. Witness statements should be collected within 4 hours of the event while details remain fresh.

## 4. Safety Signage and Communication

Construction sites must display safety signage in accordance with OSHA 1926 requirements. All signs must be legible, in good condition, and positioned at eye level. Bilingual signage is required on sites where workers speak languages other than English.

Daily safety briefings (toolbox talks) are mandatory before the start of each shift. Topics must be relevant to the day's planned activities and documented with attendance records. Weekly safety meetings involving all trades must address site-wide hazards and review recent incident trends.

## 5. Training Requirements

All construction workers must hold current OSHA 10-Hour Construction Safety certification at minimum. Supervisors and foremen are required to maintain OSHA 30-Hour certification. Specialized training certifications are required for specific tasks including crane operation, scaffolding erection, confined space entry, and excavation work.

Training records must be maintained on-site and available for inspection. Refresher training is required annually for fall protection, hazard communication, and fire extinguisher use. New employees must complete a minimum of 8 hours of site-specific safety orientation before performing any work activities.

## 6. Emergency Response

Each construction site must maintain a written emergency action plan addressing fire, severe weather, medical emergencies, and structural collapse scenarios. Emergency evacuation routes must be clearly marked and unobstructed at all times. Assembly points must be established at least 200 feet from the nearest structure.

Fire extinguishers rated at minimum 2A-10B:C must be placed within 100 feet of all work areas. First aid kits meeting ANSI Class B requirements must be available on each floor of multi-story construction. At least one certified first aid responder must be present on-site during all working hours.

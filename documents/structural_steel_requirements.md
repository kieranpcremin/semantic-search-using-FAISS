# Structural Steel Requirements

## 1. Material Specifications and Grades

All structural steel members shall conform to ASTM A992/A992M for wide-flange shapes, ASTM A500 Grade C for hollow structural sections (HSS), and ASTM A36 for plates and miscellaneous shapes. Mill test reports (MTRs) must be provided for all steel delivered to the site, documenting chemical composition and mechanical properties.

Minimum yield strength for primary structural members is 50 ksi (345 MPa). Steel with yield strength exceeding 65 ksi must receive approval from the structural engineer of record before use. All steel must be free of significant surface defects including laminations, seams, and excessive rust or pitting that reduces the cross-sectional area by more than 5%.

## 2. Connection Design and Requirements

Bolted connections shall use ASTM A325 or A490 high-strength bolts as specified in the connection details. Snug-tight installation is acceptable for bearing-type connections in non-slip-critical applications. Slip-critical connections require calibrated wrench or turn-of-nut tightening methods verified by a qualified inspector.

Welded connections must be performed by AWS D1.1 certified welders using approved welding procedure specifications (WPS). Complete joint penetration (CJP) welds on primary members require ultrasonic testing (UT) at 100% of joints. Partial joint penetration (PJP) welds and fillet welds require visual inspection at 100% and magnetic particle testing (MT) at 25% of joints.

## 3. Fire Protection for Steel Structures

Structural steel members must achieve fire resistance ratings as specified by the applicable building code. Typical requirements include 2-hour fire resistance for columns and 1.5-hour resistance for beams in commercial construction. Spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRM) must conform to ASTM E119 testing standards.

Intumescent coatings may be used as an alternative to SFRM where aesthetic considerations apply. Coating thickness must be verified using wet film and dry film thickness gauges at a frequency of one measurement per 100 square feet. Concrete encasement of steel columns provides the highest fire resistance rating and is required for critical structural elements in high-rise construction exceeding 75 feet.

## 4. Erection Procedures and Safety

Steel erection must follow a site-specific erection plan prepared by a qualified person and reviewed by the project engineer. Temporary bracing must be installed before releasing crane loads and must remain in place until permanent connections are completed. A minimum of two bolts per connection must be installed before releasing crane hooks.

All ironworkers must wear fall protection equipment when working at heights above 15 feet during steel erection, per OSHA 1926.760. Perimeter safety cables must be installed at 42 inches above the working surface. Controlled decking zones are permitted only when documented in the erection plan and approved by the site safety officer.

## 5. Quality Control and Inspection

Independent third-party inspection is required for all structural steel fabrication and erection. The inspector must be certified by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) or hold ICC structural steel inspection certification. Inspection hold points must be identified in the inspection and test plan (ITP).

Dimensional tolerances must comply with AISC Code of Standard Practice Section 6. Column plumbness shall not exceed 1/500 of the story height. Beam elevation tolerance is limited to plus or minus 3/8 inch from the specified elevation. Bolt hole alignment must achieve a minimum of 75% of the bolt group entering freely without reaming.

## 6. Load Calculations and Design Criteria

Structural steel design shall follow AISC 360 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) methodology. Dead loads must account for self-weight of steel, concrete deck, mechanical equipment, and permanent fixtures. Live loads shall meet IBC Table 1607.1 minimum requirements.

Lateral load analysis must consider both wind loads per ASCE 7 Chapter 26-31 and seismic loads per ASCE 7 Chapter 11-23. Drift limits under wind loading shall not exceed H/400 for the overall building height. Inter-story drift under seismic loading is limited to 2% of story height for structures with moment frames and 1.5% for braced frame systems.

# Electrical Safety Procedures

## 1. Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures

All electrical equipment must be de-energized and locked out before any maintenance or repair work begins. The lockout/tagout procedure follows OSHA 1910.147 and NFPA 70E requirements. Each authorized worker must apply their own individual lock and tag to the energy isolation device. Group lockout procedures using a lockbox are required when multiple workers are involved.

The LOTO sequence requires the following steps: identify all energy sources, notify affected employees, shut down equipment using normal operating controls, isolate energy sources at disconnect switches or breakers, apply locks and tags, release stored energy (capacitors, springs, hydraulic pressure), and verify zero energy state using a properly rated voltage tester. Voltage testers must be verified on a known live source before and after each use to confirm proper operation.

## 2. Grounding and Bonding Requirements

All electrical systems must be grounded in accordance with NEC Article 250. The grounding electrode system must include a concrete-encased electrode (Ufer ground) where available, supplemented by ground rods driven to a minimum depth of 8 feet. Ground resistance must not exceed 25 ohms, with a recommended target of 5 ohms or less for sensitive electronic equipment.

Equipment grounding conductors must be sized per NEC Table 250.122 based on the rating of the upstream overcurrent device. All metal raceways, enclosures, and equipment frames must be bonded to the equipment grounding conductor. Bonding jumpers are required around reducing washers, concentric knockouts, and any connection that may not provide a reliable ground path. Ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection is required for all 125-volt, 15- and 20-ampere receptacles in wet locations, bathrooms, kitchens, and construction sites.

## 3. Cable Management and Installation

Power cables must be installed in accordance with NEC Chapter 3 wiring methods. Cable routing must maintain minimum bend radius of 5 times the cable diameter for power cables and 10 times for fiber optic cables. Fill ratios for conduit systems shall not exceed 40% for three or more conductors per NEC Chapter 9 Table 1.

Cable trays must be supported at intervals not exceeding 5 feet for ladder-type trays and 8 feet for solid-bottom trays. Fire-rated barriers must be maintained at all wall and floor penetrations using listed firestop systems tested per ASTM E814. Cables passing through fire-rated assemblies must be sealed with intumescent firestop caulk or pillows within 24 hours of installation.

## 4. Electrical Panel Access and Clearances

Working space around electrical panels must comply with NEC 110.26. The minimum clear working space in front of panels is 3 feet deep, 30 inches wide (or panel width, whichever is greater), and 6.5 feet high. For systems rated 600 volts or less, working clearance depth increases based on the condition of opposing surfaces.

Electrical panel rooms must not be used for storage. Panels must be clearly labeled with a legible directory identifying all circuits. Circuit breakers and disconnect switches must be marked to indicate the equipment or area served. Panel cover screws must be maintained and panels must remain accessible at all times. Dedicated electrical spaces extending from floor to structural ceiling must be maintained above and below panelboards.

## 5. Arc Flash Protection

Arc flash hazard analysis must be performed per IEEE 1584 or NFPA 70E for all electrical equipment operating at 50 volts or greater. Arc flash warning labels must be posted on all electrical panels, switchgear, motor control centers, and other equipment where energized work could occur. Labels must indicate incident energy level, arc flash boundary, and required PPE category.

PPE requirements are based on the incident energy level at the working distance. Category 1 (4 cal/cm2) requires arc-rated long-sleeve shirt and pants. Category 2 (8 cal/cm2) adds a face shield and balaclava. Category 3 (25 cal/cm2) requires a full arc flash suit. Category 4 (40 cal/cm2) requires a multi-layer arc flash suit with hood and face shield. Work on energized systems above 40 cal/cm2 is prohibited and the system must be de-energized.

## 6. Temporary Electrical Systems on Construction Sites

Temporary power distribution for construction must comply with NEC Article 590 and OSHA 1926 Subpart K. All temporary receptacles must be protected by GFCI devices, either at the panel level or at each receptacle location. An assured equipment grounding conductor program (AEGCP) is an acceptable alternative to GFCI protection when properly administered.

Temporary wiring must be protected from physical damage by elevation (minimum 7 feet over walkways, 12 feet over vehicular traffic) or by routing in protective raceways. Temporary panels must be weatherproof when installed outdoors and must have overcurrent protection sized for the connected load. All temporary wiring installations must be inspected by a qualified electrician before energization and at intervals not exceeding 3 months during use.

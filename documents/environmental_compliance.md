# Environmental Compliance

## 1. Waste Disposal and Management

Construction waste must be managed in accordance with EPA RCRA regulations and applicable state environmental laws. Waste streams must be characterized and segregated into categories: inert debris (concrete, brick, soil), recyclable materials (metals, cardboard, clean wood), and regulated waste (paints, solvents, adhesives). A site-specific waste management plan is required before project commencement.

Hazardous waste generators must obtain an EPA identification number and comply with accumulation time limits: 90 days for large quantity generators (over 2,200 lbs/month) and 180 days for small quantity generators (220-2,200 lbs/month). Waste manifests must accompany all hazardous waste shipments from cradle to grave. Waste haulers and disposal facilities must hold current permits and licenses verified before first use.

## 2. Air Quality and Emissions Monitoring

Fugitive dust emissions must be controlled to maintain compliance with PM10 and PM2.5 ambient air quality standards. Dust suppression measures include water application at a minimum frequency of every 4 hours during active earthwork, stabilized construction entrances with minimum 50-foot gravel pads, and covered haul trucks for material transport on public roads.

Equipment exhaust emissions must meet EPA Tier 4 standards for engines manufactured after 2015. Older equipment may be used with documented emission reduction strategies such as diesel particulate filters or oxidation catalysts. Air monitoring stations should be established at the property boundary downwind of major dust-generating activities, with action levels set at 150 micrograms per cubic meter for PM10 averaged over 24 hours.

## 3. Stormwater and Water Management

A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is required under the EPA Construction General Permit (CGP) for all sites disturbing one or more acres. The SWPPP must identify potential pollutant sources, describe best management practices (BMPs), and establish inspection and maintenance schedules. The plan must be prepared by a qualified SWPPP designer and kept on-site for review.

Erosion and sediment control BMPs must be installed before land disturbance begins. Minimum requirements include silt fences along downslope perimeters, inlet protection on all storm drains within 50 feet of disturbed areas, and stabilized construction entrances. Sediment basins are required when the drainage area exceeds 10 acres. All BMPs must be inspected within 24 hours of rainfall events exceeding 0.5 inches and at intervals not exceeding 14 calendar days.

## 4. Dust Control Measures

Dust control is critical for maintaining air quality and protecting worker health on construction sites. Active earthmoving areas must apply water or approved dust suppressants to exposed soils. Wind screens with minimum 50% porosity must be installed around stockpiles exceeding 100 cubic yards that will remain for more than 7 days.

Vehicle speed limits of 15 mph must be enforced on unpaved roads within the construction site. Trackout prevention measures including wheel wash stations or rumble grids are required at all exit points. All exposed soil areas that will remain inactive for more than 14 days must be stabilized with temporary seeding, mulch, or chemical stabilization. Personal protective equipment including N95 respirators must be available to workers in high-dust areas per OSHA silica exposure limits.

## 5. Hazardous Materials Handling

All hazardous materials must be stored in designated areas with secondary containment capable of holding 110% of the largest container volume. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) must be maintained for all chemicals on-site and accessible to all workers within their work area. Chemical inventory logs must be updated weekly and submitted to the local fire department annually per EPCRA Section 312.

Spill prevention and response procedures must be documented and communicated to all site personnel. Spill kits appropriate to the materials stored must be located within 50 feet of all chemical storage areas. Any release exceeding the reportable quantity (RQ) as defined in 40 CFR 302.4 must be reported to the National Response Center within 24 hours. Contaminated soil must be characterized and disposed of at a permitted facility.

## 6. Protected Species and Habitat

Pre-construction environmental surveys must be conducted when projects are located within 500 feet of wetlands, waterways, or known habitat for threatened or endangered species. Surveys must be performed by qualified biologists during the appropriate seasonal window for the target species. Construction activities may be restricted during nesting seasons (typically March through August) within buffer zones established by the surveying biologist.

Tree removal must comply with local tree preservation ordinances. Trees designated for preservation must be protected with fencing at the drip line during construction. Root zone disturbance within the drip line of protected trees is prohibited without approval from a certified arborist. Wetland impacts require Section 404 permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, with compensatory mitigation at ratios typically ranging from 1.5:1 to 3:1 depending on wetland quality and function.

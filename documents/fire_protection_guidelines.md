# Fire Protection Guidelines

## 1. Fire Resistance Ratings

Building elements must achieve fire resistance ratings in accordance with IBC Chapter 7 and NFPA 5000. The required rating depends on construction type and occupancy classification. Type I-A construction requires 3-hour fire resistance for structural frames and bearing walls, and 2-hour resistance for floor assemblies. Type II-B construction permits 0-hour ratings for most elements except party walls.

Fire resistance testing must follow ASTM E119 standard test methods. Ratings are expressed in hours and represent the duration for which an assembly maintains structural integrity, prevents flame passage, and limits temperature rise on the unexposed surface to less than 250 degrees Fahrenheit above ambient. All fire-rated assemblies must match tested and approved configurations documented in UL Fire Resistance Directory or equivalent listings.

## 2. Automatic Sprinkler Systems

Automatic sprinkler systems must be installed in accordance with NFPA 13 for commercial and industrial buildings, NFPA 13R for residential occupancies up to 4 stories, and NFPA 13D for one- and two-family dwellings. System design density ranges from 0.10 GPM per square foot for light hazard occupancies to 0.34 GPM per square foot for extra hazard Group 2 areas.

Sprinkler head spacing must not exceed 15 feet by 15 feet for standard coverage heads in light hazard occupancies. Extended coverage sprinklers may be used with spacing up to 20 feet by 20 feet when listed for the specific application. Water supply must be capable of sustaining the design demand for a minimum of 60 minutes for light hazard and 90 minutes for ordinary hazard occupancies.

## 3. Emergency Egress and Exit Systems

Emergency exit routes must comply with IBC Chapter 10 and NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. The minimum number of exits from any story is two when the occupant load exceeds 49 persons, three exits for occupant loads between 501 and 1000, and four exits for loads exceeding 1000. Exit access travel distance shall not exceed 200 feet in unsprinklered buildings and 250 feet in fully sprinklered buildings.

Exit doors must swing in the direction of egress travel when serving an occupant load of 50 or more. Minimum clear width for exit doors is 32 inches, with exit corridors requiring a minimum width of 44 inches. Emergency lighting must provide a minimum of 1 foot-candle at floor level along the exit path and must operate for at least 90 minutes on backup power.

## 4. Fireproofing Materials and Application

Spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRM) are the most common method for protecting structural steel. Cementitious SFRM products provide 1-hour to 4-hour fire resistance depending on thickness and the member size. Application requires surface preparation including removal of oil, dirt, and loose mill scale to achieve proper adhesion.

Intumescent coatings expand when exposed to heat, forming an insulating char layer that protects the substrate. These coatings are typically 1-3 mm thick in their unexpanded state and can expand up to 50 times their original thickness. They are preferred for architecturally exposed structural steel (AESS) where traditional SFRM would be visually unacceptable.

Board-type fire protection using gypsum board or calcium silicate panels offers precise thickness control and a clean finished appearance. Two layers of 5/8-inch Type X gypsum board provide a 2-hour fire rating for most steel column configurations. This method is commonly used in renovations where spray application is impractical.

## 5. Fire Detection and Alarm Systems

Fire detection systems must comply with NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Smoke detectors are required in all corridors, lobbies, storage rooms, and equipment spaces. Heat detectors should be used in areas where smoke detectors would produce false alarms, such as kitchens, mechanical rooms, and parking garages.

Audible notification appliances must produce a minimum of 75 dBA or 15 dB above ambient noise level, whichever is greater. Visual notification appliances are required in all public and common areas per ADA requirements. The fire alarm control panel must be located in a continuously attended location or connected to a central monitoring station with maximum response time of 90 seconds.

## 6. Inspection and Maintenance Schedules

Sprinkler systems require quarterly visual inspections and annual comprehensive testing per NFPA 25. Quarterly inspections verify valve positions, gauge readings, and system component condition. Annual testing includes flow tests, alarm device testing, and obstruction investigation of system piping.

Fire extinguishers must be inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per NFPA 10. Hydrostatic testing of extinguisher cylinders is required every 5 years for water and foam types, and every 12 years for dry chemical and CO2 types. Fire doors and dampers must be inspected and tested annually per NFPA 80 and NFPA 105 respectively.
